// An Object is a generic representation of a replicated piece of data. At the top level
// it contains enough metadata in order to detect changes during anti-entropy,
// specifically, given two objects, which is the later object (or does it need to be
// created or deleted). When used in VersionVectors only the metadata of the object is
// supplied. When passed via Updates, then the full data of the object is populated.
//
// For research purposes, this anti-entropy mechanism tracks the region and owner of
// each object to determine provinence and global interactions. Because this is side
// channel information that may not necessarily be stored with the object data, it is
// recommended that an objects table be kept for fast lookups of object versions.
// Additionally, it is recommended that a history table be maintained locally so that
// Object versions can be rolled back to previous states where necessary.
