// Iterator retrieves multiple results from the underlying database, allowing users to
// loop over the results one at a time in a memory-safe fashion. The iterator may wrap
// a leveldb iterator or a sqlite rows context, fetching one row at a time in a Next
// loop. The Iterator also provides access to the versioned metadata for low-level
// interactions with the replicated data types.

	// its contents may change as the iterator progresses across the database.
