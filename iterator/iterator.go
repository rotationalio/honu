// loop. The Iterator also provides access to the versioned metadata for low-level
// interactions with the replicated data types.

	// nil if done. The caller should not modify the contents of the returned slice, and

	// Object returns the replicated object metadata and version information without
	// data. This method can be used to read meta-information and is also used for

	// iterator. Release can be called multiple times without error but after it has
	// been called, no Iterator methods will return data.
