HonuDB is an open source project that is supported by a community who will gratefully accept any contributions you might make to the project. Large or small, any contribution makes a difference! While Rotational Labs funds the development of HonuDB, we have committed to ensuring that HonuDB always remains open source; please rest assured that your contributions build the community and is not simply free work.

Database development is notoriously difficult -- but hopefully contributing to database code is not. For example, the implementation of an algorithm or component can often be accomplished without affecting the rest of the database code. If you're not sure where to start, look for `TODO` comments in the code or [get in touch with us](https://rotational.io/contact)!

Beyond the code, there are many ways to contribute:

- Submit a feature request or bug report on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rotationalio/honu/issues).
- Add to the documentation or help us with our website, [honudb.dev](https://honudb.dev).
- Write a blog post, tweet, or share our project with others.
- Star our [https://github.com/rotationalio/honu] on GitHub!
- Translate our documentation into another language.
- Write unit or integration tests for Honu.
- Tell us about how you're using HonuDB!

There are lots of ways to get involved, and we'd love to have you be a part of our community.
